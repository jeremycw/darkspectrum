Featuring:
- STL Highlighting (vimscript#1640 and vimscript#2224)
- Autocomplete Menu
- DiffSplit
- Spelling

This color scheme is based on the oblivion color scheme for gedit, but with some language specific additions and a few more tweaks to provide a wider spectrum of colors.

Thanks to junkblocker for pointing out I forgot to make DiffText something useful.
